##Constraints for this project
All of the constraints come from the [Constraints](http://constraints.co/) project by [@StevenMilne](http://twitter.com/StevenMilne)
###Enforced
- [DRY](http://constraints.co/WD1-47)
    - If I can avoid repeating methods or functions I will
- [Validation](http://constraints.co/WD1-20)
    - Discussing the project with people will use it was the first thing I did (I'll also be using it on a regular basis)
- [Make a video](http://constraints.co/WD1-31)
    - On completion I'll upload a video demo-ing the project
- [Short sentences](http://constraints.co/WD1-07)
    - I'm going to see if I can refactor all copy before launch to be clear and concise as possible. I don't know if I can manage 8 words or less but I'll try.
- [Focus on feedback](http://constraints.co/WD1-33)
    - I'll be opening up the application early to people who I think will do a good job of exposing it's weakpoints. I'll make a point of taking all the feedback and addressing each point individually
- [Write a blog post](http://constraints.co/WD1-42)
    - Regular blogs throughout development, the first one will accompany this file being pushed to github

###Possible

###Failed/removed
- [No hover states](http://constraints.co/WD1-10)
    - I'd like a flat design if possible but if it looks bad and isn't clear I'll drop it in a heartbeat
